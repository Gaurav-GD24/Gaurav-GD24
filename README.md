## My short story

After graduation, I went through more phases than a cat chasing its own tail. I made mistakes, messed up big time, and stumbled upon life's banana peels. But guess what? I learned more from those mishaps than any lecture or textbook could teach me. 💥 Finally, I found my true calling, frontend development! It's like discovering the perfect pair of shoes, but for my coding journey. Every day, I'm learning new things and working towards becoming a Good frontend developer.
